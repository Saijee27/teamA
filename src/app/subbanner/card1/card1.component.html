    <h3>Problems of ear</h3>
    <hr style=" width: 250px;">
    <h4>There are many different types of ear problems</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Earwax buildup: Earwax is a natural substance that helps to protect the ear canal. However, if too much earwax builds up, it can cause hearing problems, pain, and dizziness. You can try to remove earwax buildup at home by using a warm, wet washcloth to clean the outer ear canal. If this doesn't work, you can see a doctor or audiologist for a professional cleaning.</li>
        <li>Ear infection: Ear infections are common in children, but they can also occur in adults. Ear infections are caused by bacteria or viruses, and they can cause pain, fever, and hearing problems. Antibiotics are usually prescribed to treat ear infections. In the meantime, you can try using a warm compress on the affected ear to relieve pain.</li>
        <li>Swimmer's ear: Swimmer's ear is an infection of the outer ear canal. It is caused by water getting trapped in the ear canal and bacteria growing. Swimmer's ear can cause pain, itching, and swelling. You can try to treat swimmer's ear at home by using a warm compress on the affected ear and by taking over-the-counter pain relievers. If your symptoms don't improve after a few days, you should see a doctor.</li>
